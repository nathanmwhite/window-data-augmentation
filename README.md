# A Window-based Approach to Data Augmentation for Text Normalization

This repository will contain the code for the paper "A Window-based Approach to Data Augmentation for Text Normalization."

TODO:
1. Port code from Google Repository--focus on character-based approach.
2. Convert code to handle SOTA libraries.
3. Restructure code to handle multiple inputs.
4. Develop data for (plausibly) Chumash and Pomo data, consent permitting.
